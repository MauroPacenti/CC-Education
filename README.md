# CC-Education Project

The **CC-Education** project is designed to provide a user-friendly interface for accessing various services offered by the company. The application includes key features that allow users to interact with the system and obtain the information they need, as well as manage appointments and service requests.

## Features:

1. **Information Form**  
   A form that allows users to request detailed information about the services offered by the company. Users can fill out the form to inquire about the various educational services and get more insights into the offerings.

2. **Booking Form**  
   A form that enables users to book appointments with the company. This feature allows users to schedule time for consultations, meetings, or other services provided by the company.

3. **Backoffice Dashboard**  
   A dashboard accessible only by company staff, providing tools to manage the lifecycle of both information and booking requests. The backoffice allows administrators to view, update, and process incoming requests from the information and booking forms.

4. **Mailing System**  
   Every request notification is managed by **Java Mail Sender**, to confirm the operational status to users and to notice company staff.

## Technologies Used:

- **Frontend**:  
  The frontend of the application is built with **Js/Html/Css**, providing a dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly interface.

- **Backend**:  
  The backend is developed using **Java Spring Boot**, a powerful framework for building production-grade, scalable web applications. Spring Boot offers features such as security, data access, and API development that streamline backend development.

- **Database**:  
  **MariaDB** is used as the database management system (DBMS). It provides robust data storage, management, and security features to handle all application data, from user inputs to booking details.
